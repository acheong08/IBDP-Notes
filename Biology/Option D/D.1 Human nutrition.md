# Essential nutrients

What is a nutrient? A nutrient is any chemical substance that can be used by the human body. Some nutrients are essential for the health and survival of humans. The body is incapable of synthesising these molecules from other substances already present in the body and they must therefore be contained in a balanced diet.

Essential nutrients are grouped into:

- **Minerals:** for example phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron.
- **Vitamins:** for example vitamins A, C, D, K.
- ​**Amino acids:** for example histidine, tryptophan and others.
- **Fatty acids:** for example certain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

![Foods containing essential nutrients.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/shutterstock_367400582.39cbed2e17d435169882.jpeg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Foods containing essential nutrients.

All of these essential nutrients will be discussed in the following sections.

Our body takes in other non-essential nutrients such as fructose or dietary fibre. Fructose can be made by our body and as such it cannot be considered as essential. Dietary fibre aids in the digestive process. If the body does not get all its essential nutrients (a **deficiency**) it can cause malnutrition. However malnutrition can also be caused by:

- An **imbalance.**
- An **excess** of nutrients.

Each of these causes leads to a different type of malnutrition. For example, a deficient intake of proteins can lead to kwashiorkor, a disorder that causes oedema, irritability, anorexia, ulcerating skin, and an enlarged liver.

#### Be Aware

**Malnutrition** is a consequence of an unbalanced diet. A person can eat a lot of food but still be malnourished. However, when an individual simply does not have enough to eat this can lead to **starvation.**

# Essential fatty acids and amino acids

The human body cannot synthesise certain fatty acids and therefore these are considered to be **essential**. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are two examples of such essential fatty acids. You need omega-3 fatty acids for numerous normal body functions, such as controlling blood clotting and building cell membranes in the brain. Omega-6 fatty acids lower LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol) and reduce inflammation, and they are protective against heart disease.

These fatty acids are chemically known as: alpha-linolenic acid (**Figure 1**; omega-3), and linoleic acid (**Figure 2**; omega-6). The numbers refer to the first double bond counting from the CH3 (Methyl, position 1) group of the fatty acid.

![Alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3).](<https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.2.1%20Alpha-linolenic%20acid%20(omega-3).6ba17b4d116f081b3b24.jpg?w=900&auto=compress>)

**Figure 2.** Linoleic acid (omega-6)

| Fatty Acid                 | Description                                                    | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) | An omega-3 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds. | ALA is an essential fatty acid that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through the diet. It is a precursor for the synthesis of other omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are important for brain and eye development, and have anti-inflammatory effects. ALA may also have cardiovascular benefits, such as lowering triglyceride levels and reducing the risk of heart disease.                                                          |
| Linoleic acid (LA)         | An omega-6 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and 2 double bonds. | LA is also an essential fatty acid that must be obtained through the diet. It is a precursor for the synthesis of other omega-6 fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, which is important for the inflammatory response and immune system function. LA may also have cardiovascular benefits, such as reducing blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels. However, excessive intake of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to inflammation and increase the risk of chronic diseases. |

**Table 1.** Essential fatty acids.

These fatty acids can be found in a range of foods:

Omega 3 fatty acids in fatty fish (such as salmon); some vegetable oils, such as soybean, rapeseed, flaxseed; and in Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach, walnuts.

Omega 6 fatty acids in safflower, corn, cottonseed, and soybean oils.

#### Be aware

An excess of fats can be bad for your health, but if you do not eat the essential fatty acids you can have serious health problems.

## Essential amino acids

You should know by now that in most living organisms protein synthesis requires 20 different L-amino acids. In humans, nine are considered to be essential.

The nine **essential** amino acids humans cannot synthesise are: **phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine,** and **histidine**.

**Tyrosine** can be synthesised by the human body when phenylalanine is present in the diet.

**Arginine** cannot be synthesised by infants so it must be present in the diet as well.

As these two can be synthesised under some conditions but not others, these are called **conditionally essential** amino acids.

Most human proteins require all 20 amino acids so if one of the essential amino acids is missing from the diet certain proteins cannot be synthesised. One form of malnutrition is protein deficiency. Its symptoms are fluid retention in the tissues (oedema) and it is often visible in the abdominal area (swollen belly).

Some of the processes in which amino acids are involved are summarised in **Figure 3**.

![Roles of amino acids.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.1.2.3%20Roles%20of%20amino%20acids.833b4aa811d0b3e69f59.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 3**. Roles of amino acids.

#### Important

Lack of essential amino acids affects the production of proteins.

# Essential minerals and vitamins

When you think of the composition of a human body, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and water come to mind. However, our body contains many other elements which it needs for various functions, or as a component of biomolecules. **Figure 1** shows the elemental composition of an average male, with a mass of approximately 70 kg.

![A selection of the elements present in a human body.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.3.1%20Elemental%20composition%20of%20an%20average%20male.d3aafd69e2fdcc26f278.jpe?w=450&auto=compress)

**Figure 1**. Composition of main elements found in the body by mass.

Trace elements include boron (B), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), fluorine (F), iodine (I), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), silicon (Si), tin (Sn), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn).

less than 1.0

The table shows many different elements, some of which may be unfamiliar to you. Some, however, such as iron, are needed for the functioning of haemoglobin. Iron atoms are the central atom in the non-protein, heme group of haemoglobin. You may be surprised to know that the human body also contains arsenic. Arsenic, which has a poisonous reputation, may be a necessary ultra-trace element for humans. Some lab experiments on rats have shown that it can inhibit growth.

Another important trace element is iodine. Iodine is needed for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which can increase basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, and help regulate long bone growth (in combination with growth hormone) and maturation of neurones. An iodine deficiency, which is quite common in areas where there is no or very little iodine in the diet, can result in goitre and severe retardation in children (see section [Iodine deficiency](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/iodine-deficiency-id-6022/)).

Calcium and phosphorus are necessary for the formation of bones and teeth. Calcium is also necessary for muscle contraction. Sodium and potassium are involved in the propagation of the nerve impulse.

## Vitamins

Vitamins cannot be synthesised by the human body and must therefore be included in the diet. They are divided into water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins. **Table 2** lists all the vitamins needed in human diets with their daily requirements, and in which type of food each one can be found. The deficiency symptoms are many, as vitamins take part in many metabolic processes.

#### Important

Vitamins are chemically diverse carbon compounds that cannot be synthesized by the body.

Water-soluble vitamins, when taken to excess, will be excreted in the urine. Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body, but can cause problems when taken in excess.

# Malnutrition and the appetite control centre

Malnutrition is the result of any deviation from a normal healthy diet. It is not be confused with starvation, which is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake. The three main causes of malnutrition are:

- **Deficiency**, a diet lacking in one or more particular nutrients.
- **Imbalance**, a diet that has an inadequate intake of a particular nutrient.
- **Excess**, a diet that has a disproportionate intake of e.g. carbohydrates, fats or proteins.

Across the globe, malnutrition can be found in every society or culture. **Figure 1** shows the global malnutrition rates.

![Global malnutrition rates.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.4.1%20Global%20malnutrition%20rates.d634c6416aef25b92129.jpeg?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Global malnutrition rates.

Even in nations with a high wealth status, cases of malnutrition have been documented. In affluent societies it can be caused by an excessive intake of fats and refined carbohydrates. Such a diet combined with lack of exercise can lead to obesity.

## Appetite control

Appetite is controlled by the appetite control centre in the hypothalamus (ACC). The centre regulates our desire to eat. When the stomach is empty, ghrelin is released, stimulating appetite. When food is ingested, the release of peptide PYY3-36 from the small intestine (along with insulin from the pancreas and leptin from adipose tissue) inhibit appetite. **Figure 2** shows which factors and hormones influence the ACC in the hypothalamus.

![Appetite Control Centre and factors influencing appetite.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.4.2%20%20Appetite%20Control%20Centre%20and%20factors%20influencing%20appetite.cd6eca673f70949508f0.jpeg?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2**. Appetite control centre and factors influencing appetite.

Without appetite control we could easily overeat, which would cause elevated blood glucose levels.

# Overweight: effects on health

The body mass index (BMI) is a value used to determine whether a patient is within normal parameters of mass or weight. It is quite a useful tool to decide whether you are under- or overweight, but must be used with care, as there are other factors to be kept in mind, such as the proportion of muscular and adipose tissues.

#### Definition

The **BMI** is the body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the body height (in metres).

BMI=massheight2(kg/m2)BMI=massheight2(kg/m2){\\rm BMI}= \\frac {\\rm mass}{\\rm height^2} (\\rm kg/m^2)

Someone is considered to be overweight when her or his [BMI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm) is between 25.1 and 29.9 kg m-2. Obesity is associated with BMI values above 30.0 kg m-2. BMI is a rather coarse measurement. Muscles have a high mass density so some professional athletes can have BMI values above 30 without being considered to be obese.

Obesity is a global problem. **Figure 1** shows data from [WHO](http://www.who.org) depicting the global obesity prevalence.

![Global obesity prevalence.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.1.5.1-Global-obesity-prevalence.e9361967645c57a5d438.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1**. Global obesity prevalence.

An unbalanced diet is unhealthy, or in other words, it can make you ill. Two common consequences of such a diet are type II diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) which includes hypertension (high blood pressure).

**Type II diabetes,** also known as late-onset diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is the most common form of diabetes. In individuals with this condition the beta cells in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, these patients develop insulin resistance, which means that the insulin receptors on the cells are no longer stimulated by insulin. See also the section [insulin, glucagon and diabetes.](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/insulin-glucagon-core-id-1891/)

##### Probable causes of type II diabetes:

- High levels of fatty acids in the blood as a result of diets high in fat but low in fibre.
- Overweight, especially obesity, associated with a lack of exercise.
- Genetic makeup that influences fat metabolism.

The symptoms of type II diabetes:

- Increased (elevated) glucose levels in the blood urine.
- Frequent need to urinate (may lead to excessive thirst).
- Tiredness and fatigue.
- Some loss of weight.

Diabetes can also increase your chances of developing CHD.

#### Hypertension and CHD

Hypertension is blood pressure above the norm. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a disease in which a substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply blood with oxygen to the heart muscle.

There is a correlation between certain diets and the incidence of CHD. Some diets, for example Mediterranean, include a high intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grain products, and lower amounts of fish and red meat. As a result populations in, for example, Greece, Italy and Japan have relatively low rates of CHD. There is also a strong correlation between a high incidence of CHD (including hypertension) and a high intake of saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids can be deposited inside the arteries. If the deposits combine with cholesterol they may lead to atherosclerosis (as shown in **Figure 2**), which leads to hypertension or can cause angina and heart attacks. In a "chicken and egg" scenario, hypertension also can cause damage to blood vessels, increasing the risk of developing even more atherosclerotic plaques.

![Plaque formation in arteries can lead to hypertension.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.5.2%20Plaque%20formation%20in%20arteries%20can%20lead%20to%20hypertension.57d0029a74c9a508f678.jpe?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2**. Plaque formation in arteries can lead to hypertension.

**Correlation and cause**

It is important to remember that **correlation** between two variables does not necessarily indicate **cause**. The causes of type II diabetes are not fully understood but there is a strong correlation of risk with being overweight and diet. However, many other factors can play a role in the development of type II diabetes: gender, socioeconomic status, culture and ethnic group.

D.1 Human nutrition

# Starvation and anorexia

The most extreme form of malnutrition is **starvation,** which is caused by a severe reduction in caloric energy intake. Prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and death if caloric energy intake is not restored in time. Initially the glycogen stores in the liver are mobilised, but once they are depleted the body has to resort to other sources of energy.

The loss of muscle and adipose tissue mass is caused by the body's need for caloric intake and to protect the vital systems such as the nervous system and heart muscle. The body breaks down muscles and lipids to generate energy and amino acids. This process is known as **catabolysis**.

Vitamin deficiency is a common result of starvation, and can lead to anaemia (vitamin B12 deficiency), beriberi (vitamin B1 deficiency), pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency), and scurvy (vitamin C deficiency).

## Anorexia

**Anorexia** is a medical term for lack of appetite. **Anorexia nervosa** is a type of anorexia. It is an eating disorder characterized by food restriction and an irrational fear of weight gain. Many patients suffering from anorexia nervosa do not lose their appetites but their intake of food is very limited. Anorexia nervosa has many variant causes and is often accompanied by an unrealistic body self-perception. It can lead to excessive weight loss.

Anorexia nervosa leads to electrolyte imbalance, skeletal and heart muscle reduction, reduced blood pressure and a slower heart rate. The body can become covered in a fine growth of thin hair. In female patients it can also lead to reduced or absence of menstrual cycles. Extreme cases can lead to death.

#### Examiner Tip

You must know that there is breakdown of heart muscle due to anorexia.

D.1 Human nutrition

# Vitamin C and scurvy

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C is also known as L-ascorbic acid. Humans and some animals cannot synthesise this compound. Vitamin C is needed for the production of collagen, the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom, found in skin, connective tissues, tendons and blood vessels. Vitamin C cannot be synthesised by some animals because they have a mutation in the GLO gene which codes for an enzyme that is needed for the last step in the synthesis of L-Ascorbic acid.

A vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy, a disease that was common amongst sailors in past centuries because of a lack of citrus fruits in their diets. Citrus fruits are a good source of dietary vitamin C.

![Lemons and limes: good source of L-Ascorbic acid.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/shutterstock_363111740.b959e4dc5f5cf5099919.jpeg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Lemons and limes: a good source of L-Ascorbic acid.

All the primates and some smaller monkeys require vitamin C in their diet. Lack of Vitamin C causes scurvy.

## Scurvy

The main symptoms of scurvy are:

- **Bleeding gums, gingivitis or loose teeth**. Vitamin C is necessary for the synthesis of collagen, which builds and maintains tissue.
- **Lack of energy**. Loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
- **Mood swings** **or depression**. Irritability and rapid changes in mood may indicate a severe deficiency. Depression is common.
- **Chronic joint pain**. Bleeding in the joints causes constant pain.
- **Suppressed immune system**. Frequent diseases.
- **Slow wound healing and bruising**. Bruising occurs easily and wounds take a long time to heal.

In 1907 two Norwegian scientists, Axel Holst and Theodor Frølich, published a paper (Journal of Hygiene/Volume 7/Issue 05/October 1907, pp 634-671) describing an animal model (using guinea pigs, see **Figure 2**) for scurvy. The study was controversial because it went against existing and accepted theories on the causes and prevention of scurvy. Their work falsified earlier theories which suggested that scurvy was specific to humans. It also paved the way for other studies that can be used to calculate how much of a particular nutrient should be ingested per day without endangering your health.

![Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) eating an apple.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/shutterstock_307304813.f7eede2de4dcad7a8f9f.jpeg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) eating an apple.

You may be familiar with the acronym RDA, recommended daily amount. The recommended level of vitamin C for humans is about 50 mg per day. But how is this value calculated? Often animal studies are used. Below is a simplified example of how such a study could be conducted.

#### Important

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is produced by some mammals, but not others that need a dietary supply.

### Animal study

Guinea pigs, which cannot manufacture vitamin C, are fed diets containing different levels of vitamin C, while all other nutrients and conditions are controlled.

1. A control group (group 0) does not receive any foods containing vitamin C.
2. Other groups (groups 1 to 10) get increasing levels of a daily supplement of vitamin C in their diet, e.g. group 1 gets 10 mg of vitamin C per day, group 2: 20 mg vitamin C per day, etc.
3. The control group will start to develop symptoms of scurvy.
4. Perhaps also groups 1 and 2 may show some symptoms, but above a certain daily supplement of vitamin C, e.g. 30 mg per day, the guinea pigs do not show the common symptoms of scurvy.
5. The data collected this way can be used to calculate the amount of vitamin C required by a human.

In this subtopic there are two Nature of Science aspects (1.9 and 2.9) that apply:

1\. Falsification of theories. The theory that scurvy was unique to humans was falsified by showing that guinea pigs could also suffer from scurvy with similar symptoms.

2\. As testing in humans is not possible, cohort studies and case control studies are used to strengthen understanding of causation of scurvy.

# Phenylketonuria

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disease. A gene coding for phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyses the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, is mutated. This results in the inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine. PKU is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait which means that patients with PKU have two recessive (mutated) alleles. As the enzyme can no longer catalyse the last and rate limiting step, phenylalanine accumulates in the body.

PKU occurs in about 1 in 10,000 births. Early diagnosis of phenylketonuria is important because it is treatable by dietary means.

Medical consequences of PKU:

- Intillectual disability
- Reduced growth of the head
- Lack of skin and hair pigmentation
- Seizures

PKU needs to be detected and diagnosed within 24 hours of birth. The [Guthrie test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_heel_prick) is used for this purpose (see **Figure 1**). Up until that time, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels in the infant are normal as a result of the normal metabolism of its mother.

![Guthrie test for PKU.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/Phenylketonuria_testing.e7865244917cd2cd0921.jpeg?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Guthrie test for PKU.

PKU patients need to maintain a diet low in phenylalanine. **Figure 2** shows which foods can be eaten safely (right) and will allow a PKU patient to live a normal life. The high phenylalanine foods shown on the left should be avoided.

![PKU diet.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.8.2%20PKU%20diet.f131a5b7748cf4f89013.jpe?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2**. PKU diet.

The artificial sweetener aspartame contains phenylalanine, so children with PKU cannot eat chewing gum or drink any soft drink that contains this sweetener.

#### Exam tip

You must know the cause and treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).

# Vitamin D deficiency

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D (calciferol) is needed for the absorption of calcium in the digestive system. Calcium is needed to build healthy bones, therefore a vitamin D deficiency can lead to softening or malformation of the bones. This condition is known as **osteomalacia** in adults (milder condition) or **rickets** in children (more serious condition) (see **Figure 1**).

Two of the most important roles of vitamin D are to maintain skeletal calcium balance by promoting calcium absorption in the intestines **and** maintaining calcium and phosphate levels for bone formation. In breastfeeding mothers whose vitamin D intake is low, this can cause problems with the bone mineralisation of their infants.

![Effect of vitamin D deficiency causing rickets.  ​](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/D.1.9.1%20Effect%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20causing%20rickets.841daabad7c8c8cc4994.jpg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Effect of vitamin D deficiency causing rickets

Vitamin D is found in foods such as oily fish, particularly salmon, herring and tuna; egg yolk; liver; and dairy products including milk, cheese and butter.

Exposing the human skin to UV light with a wavelength between 290-310 nm triggers the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D is one of the few vitamins that can be made in the body and therefore does not really fit the definition of a vitamin. If your skin is exposed for a short time in the open air it is enough to supply your body with a daily dose of vitamin D. During winter time at very Northerly or Southerly latitudes, e.g. the north of Norway or in Patagonia, there is not enough sunlight to trigger the synthesis of vitamin D. Fortunately, a certain amount of vitamin D, which is fat soluble, can be stored by the liver.

#### Theory of Knowledge

There are positive effects of exposure to sun such as the production of Vitamin D as well as health risks associated with exposure to UV rays. How can conflicting knowledge claims be balanced?

# Cholesterol and coronary heart disease

Cholesterol has a bad reputation, but it is the precursor of **bile acids,** **Vitamin** **D** and steroid hormones such as **progesterone** and **oestrogen**. Furthermore, cholesterol protects the membrane integrity of animal cells. The presence of cholesterol in the cellular membrane enables the cell to change shape and move about.

#### Be aware

Cholesterol in blood is an indicator of the risk of coronary heart disease.

An average human liver produces about 1 g of cholesterol per day. In addition, some western diets add another 307 mg per day, which is above the recommended level by the [Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee](http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines). The food shown in **Figure 1** may be a delicious breakfast for some, but if your blood cholesterol level is above a certain limit it may be bad for you to consume it too often.

### Cholesterol and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

The table below shows the recommended level of blood cholesterol that poses no elevated risk, as well as the elevated levels that do pose a risk for developing CHD.

**Table 1.** Total blood cholesterol levels and risks.

**Level in mg dm-3 (sometimes expressed as mg dl-1)**

**Level in mmol dm-3**

**Interpretation based on**

[Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3422148)

<200

<5.2

Desirable level corresponding to lower risk for heart disease.

200-240

5\.2 - 6.2

Borderline high risk.

\>240

\>6.2

High risk.

The total cholesterol that is mentioned in the table is the sum of Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL). Only cholesterol contained in LDL has been associated with an increased risk of developing CHD. Other factors that could play a role in being at risk for developing CHD are genetic factors or a lack of mobility. Reducing the intake of dietary cholesterol can have a very limited effect on lowering total blood cholesterol levels, but drugs like statin have been shown to be far more effective. [**Statins**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin) are a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels. The drug inhibits the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyses the second step in the pathway from [Acetyl CoA](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/krebs-ahl-id-1924/) to cholesterol.

The relationship between saturated fat intake and total blood cholesterol levels is a correlation and not a causal relation!

D.1 Human nutrition

# Monitoring dietary intake

A balanced diet is a combination of foods that contains all essential and non-essential nutrients in the right proportion. The proportion is key here. Most health departments around the world have accepted that you should reduce your intake of fats in favor of increasing your intake of fruit and vegetables. The 'wheel' of foods depicted in **Figure 1** shows the approximate proportion of the foods you should eat on a daily basis. The scientific evidence for this hypothesis is mainly based on epidemiological and statistical studies that look into the correlation between diet and the incidence of certain diseases such as CHD or various cancers.

**Figure 1.** Healthy diet in the accepted balanced proportions.

Keeping your caloric intake to an accepted level is also healthy advice. In the International System of Units, energy is measured in joules (J). The kilojoule (kJ) is most often used for food-related quantities. A widely used but older unit of energy is the kilocalorie (kcal or Cal). 1 kcal = 4.184 kilojoules. The accepted values for caloric intake are 11,300 and 8,800 kJ for men and women (respectively) between the ages of 31 and 50.

In children, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) are as follows:

a) Total calorie intake value (TCV): 120 to 160 kcal/kg of weight.

b) Proteins: 10 to 15% of the total calorie value (TCV), 3g/kg of weight for children.

c) Carbohydrates: 35 to 60% of the TCV.

d) Fats: 35 to 50% of the TCV.

e) Fibre: age in years + 5g (i.e. a four-year-old needs 9g of fibre per day).

Source: RDA. Recommended Dietary Allowance. 10th ed. Washington, D.C. National Academy Press; 1989. \[book online\].

#### Be Aware

The accepted values for daily intake (11,300 and 8,800 kJ) for men and women (respectively) between the ages of 31 and 50 are averages. Other factors influence this number such as how active you are, e.g. running three to five times per week, or living a sedentary lifestyle. In the latter case your caloric intake should be less.

There are many databases that include information on the nutritional content of different foods. For example, **Table** **1** shows the nutrient profile in 100 g of different pulses.

Pulse

This information could be used to find out the amount of pulses needed to cover the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of different nutrients in children.

To keep track of your caloric intake many websites and apps are available. Two are mentioned here, although they are in no way an endorsement, but serve only as an example.

## Calculating energy content in food

The energy content in foods can be measured by burning a known mass of the food to test. The burning food is placed under the test tube with water. The heat liberated by the burning food is absorbed by a known volume of water. The rise in temperature is recorded (**Figure 4)**. The energy value is calculated as temperature rise × mass of water × specific heat capacity of water (4.184 joules/gºC or 1 calorie/gºC).

![Calculating energy content in food.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.1.11.4%20Calculating%20energy%20content%20in%20food.3f6b6b096a33f7ebe2b6.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 4.** Experiment to calculate energy content in a peanut.

For example: you place 20 g of water that is at 20ºC in the test tube. You burn a peanut, and the temperature of the water is now 65ºC. Calculate the energy content in 100 g of peanuts.

Change in temperature: 45ºC

Mass of water: 20 g

Mass of one peanut: 0.5 g

Specific heat capacity of water: 1 calorie/gºC

Energy in 1 peanut = 45ºC × 20 g × 1 calorie/gºC = 900 calories

Energy per g of peanut = 900 calories/0.5 g = 1,800 calories/g

Energy in 100 g peanuts = 180,000 calories = 180 Kcal = 753 kJ
