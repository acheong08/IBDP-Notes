D.2 Digestion

# Neuronal and hormonal control of digestion

Have you ever walked by a bakery and smelt freshly baked bread? What about when you see an advertisement for crunchy potato crisps? Or even as you read these lines, don’t you feel your mouth watering? Not only will the presence or smell of food stimulate the digestive system, but also thinking about it will make your body secrete saliva and gastric juice. This would prepare the body for the future intake of food.

Mechanical, nervous and hormonal mechanisms control the secretion of digestive juices. The nervous control is mainly provided by the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic system is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympathetic system controls processes involved in responses to danger, while the parasympathetic system controls homeostasis and processes related to rest and digestion.The parasympathetic system speeds up digestion when food is ingested, while the sympathetic slows it down when there is no food available. **Figure 1** is a flow chart of the control of the main digestive processes.

![Control of the digestive processes.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.2.1.1%20Control%20of%20the%20digestive%20processes.1a829f56c5f7afe6e8b7.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Control of the digestive processes.

Having food in your mouth will induce the secretion of saliva and the presence of food in the gut will induce the secretion of gastric juice (especially after eating proteins), intestinal juice, pancreatic juice and bile (especially if you have eaten fats).

The hormones involved in the chemical control of digestion are gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK). These hormones are secreted in the digestive system and travel through blood to the target organs.

**Gastrin** is produced by special cells (called G cells) in the stomach, duodenum and pancreas, in response to physical stimulation due to the presence of food, as well as to chemical stimulation by protein. When gastrin is released, it stimulates the production of gastric juice by the parietal cells in the gastric glands. Gastric juice contains a mixture of water, hydrochloric acid and other inorganic ions, enzymes (pepsin, rennin), mucus, various polypeptides, and intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for absorbing vitamin B12. Gastric juice changes the pH of the food content from 6.7 to 2, providing acidic conditions that will enhance digestion. When there is sufficient gastric juice present (around 1 to 1.5 litres), the production of gastrin will stop and therefore so will the secretion of gastric juice.

**Secretin** is produced by special cells in the small intestine in response to the presence of acid fluid. The presence of gastric acid activates prosecretin into secretin. When released, it stimulates the production of alkali by the pancreas, neutralising the intestinal components. When the pH of the intestine reaches 8, the production of pancreatic juice is stopped by negative feedback. Secretin plays a role in osmoregulation as it regulates water homeostasis throughout the body by acting on the kidney, hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

**Cholecystokinin** (CCK) is also produced by the small intestine when food is present in this organ. It controls the release of pancreatic juice from the pancreas and bile from the gall bladder (bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder). It also acts as a hunger suppressor.

All the hormones you have just studied will enhance digestion, but there are other hormones that will suppress this process. **Somatostatin** is an inhibitory hormone secreted by special cells in the stomach, duodenum and pancreas. This hormone travels through blood to directly inhibit acid producing cells. It also acts indirectly by preventing the release of gastrin, CCK and secretin, thus slowing down the digestive process.

Therefore, acid secretion is regulated by the nervous system, which causes direct stimulation of the parietal cells to secrete acid, and indirect stimulation by decreasing somatostatin secretion. In addition, a regulatory feedback mechanism exists whereby the presence of acid in the lumen of the stomach stimulates somatostatin secretion, which in turn slows down acid secretion.

## **Exocrine glands**

**Exocrine glands** have ducts that carry their secretory product to the surface of the body or the lumen of the gut. These glands include the sweat, sebaceous, and mammary glands and the glands that secrete digestive enzymes. **Figure 2** shows the development of an exocrine gland.

![Development of exocrine gland.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.5.1.1%20Development%20of%20exocrine%20glands.3df2455f72c001673f91.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Development of exocrine gland.

In the following sections, you will be studying how exocrine glands secrete digestive enzymes into the lumen of the gut.

How were the first studies into digestion in the stomach performed? In 1822 Alexis St Martin, an 18-year-old Canadian, was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a musket. Although the wound was serious and left a hole in his body, he survived. His doctor, William Beaumont, made thorough observation of what occurred in the stomach and recorded his observations between the years 1825 and 1833. He was able to extract gastric juice by introducing an elastic tube into the stomach through the wound. He then observed which foods were digested and under which conditions.

# Absorption in the small intestine

Once digested, the food products are absorbed by the digestive system into the blood or lymphatic system and carried to different organs, especially the liver, where they are metabolised into other molecules. **Table 1** summarises the digestive process.

## The villus

Most of the absorption occurs in the small intestine. The wall of the small intestine is lined with **villi** that increase the surface area for the absorption of substances. Each villus has a central lacteal whose function is mainly the absorption of fats, and capillaries that carry the rest of the absorbed molecules to other organs. Most capillaries join to form the **hepatic portal vein** that carries blood to the liver. The structure of cells in the epithelium of the villus is adapted to the absorption of food (**Figure 1**).

The main adaptations are:

- Increased surface area due to presence of villi and microvilli.
- Many mitochondria to provide energy for active transport.
- Presence of capillaries in villi for absorption of digested foods.
- Presence of lacteal for absorption of absorbed lipids.
- Presence of pinocytotic vesicles aid the uptake of fluids.
- Presence of tight junctions to ensure molecules do not escape through the membrane, and to maintain a concentration gradient.
- Enzymes (peptidases and disaccharidases) bound to epithelial membranes to complete hydrolysis/digestion.

#### Exam tip

Check the structure of the villus in [topic 6](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/the-big-picture-id-2787/).

**Figure 1.** Structure of the villus.

The electronmicrograph of the epithelium of a villus shows epithelial cells with many microvilli (arrows) and goblet cells (asterisk) (**Figure 2**).

**Figure 2.** Electronmicrograph of villus epithelium.

The cross section of the wall of the small intestine consists of five layers (**Figure 3**):

- **Mucosa**: contains the epithelium formed by enterocytes, goblet cells and endocrine cells. Enterocytes are cells that have microvilli; they digest and absorb substances. Goblet cells produce mucus and endocrine cells secrete hormones.
- **Submucosa**: contains blood vessels and connective tissue.
- **Circular muscle layer**: smooth muscle arranged in a circular manner.
- **Longitudinal muscle layer**: smooth muscle arranged in a longitudinal manner.
- **Serosa**: single layer of epithelial cells with connective tissue.

**Figure 3**. Cross section of the small intestine.

## Absorption of digested foods

**Polysaccharides** are mainly hydrolysed to glucose and absorbed by epithelial cells of the small intestine. **Glucose** is co-transported with sodium (Na+) by facilitated diffusion. In order for this to happen, Na+ must first be transported out of the cell by active transport (along the basal membrane). This powers the co-transport of glucose and Na+ into the epithelial cells via the apical membrane. The glucose is then carried along the epithelial cell to a sugar transporter protein that allows its transport into the capillaries, which will carry it to the hepatic portal vein.

Something similar happens to **proteins**. These are digested by proteases into **amino acids,** which are transported by co-transport with Na+ into the epithelial cells. Amino acid carrier proteins then carry them by facilitated diffusion into the capillaries.

**Fats (or lipids)** are emulsified in the intestines by bile. This transforms them into smaller droplets, allowing lipases to digest them into fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol will be absorbed and used in carbohydrate metabolism and the **fatty acids** will diffuse into the small intestine epithelial cells. Long chain fatty acids will combine with proteins to form **chylomicrons**. The chylomicrons travel to the border of the cell in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and are expelled by exocytosis to later enter the lacteal, thus entering the lymphatic system. **Figure 4** summarizes the absorption of foods in the epithelial cells of the villus.

#### Important

Exocytosis is a form of active transport. Active transport requires energy; therefore villi epithelial cells are rich in mitochondria, as a lot of ATP is required.

D.2 Digestion

# Absorption in the large intestine

By the time food reaches the large intestine, most of it has already been digested and absorbed. The large intestine is in charge of the absorption of water and minerals and vitamin K. **Insoluble fibre** (e.g. wheat bran, fruit skin) is not digested so it has no nutritional value. Then why should we include it in our diet? Fibre is important because it increases faecal mass, thus stimulating peristaltic movements.

#### Definition

**Dietary fibre** is the non-digestible carbohydrates, especially cellulose, and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.

Materials that are not absorbed are egested as faeces. The materials that are not absorbed are cellulose and lignin from plant matter, bile pigments, the remains of intestinal epithelial cells and bacteria. Peristalsis of the walls of the large intestine will push the faecal matter towards the rectum and eventually eliminate it through the anus.

The rate of transit of materials through the large intestine is positively correlated with their fibre content. The bar graph (**Figure 1**) shows that as dietary fibre increases the prevalence of constipation decreases, especially in women, in a study of the USA population.

![Effect of dietary fibre intake on the prevalence of constipation.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.2.4.2-Effect-of-dietary-fibre-intake-on-the-prevalence-of-constipation.5cf86c9c14584c1fe016.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Effect of dietary fibre intake on the prevalence of constipation.

#### Definition

**Constipation** is unsatisfactory defecation, characterised by infrequent bowel movement, difficult stool passage, or both.

An infection of the intestines, due to a virus, bacterium or parasite, will cause inflammation of the epithelial cells lining the intestine. This will reduce the absorption of water, causing the feces to be loose or liquid (diarrhoea). If the infection persists for several days it can cause dehydration.

## **Cholera**

**Cholera** is a disease caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium **Vibrio cholerae**. When cholera toxin is released from the bacteria in the infected intestine, it binds to the intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes), triggering endocytosis of the toxin.The toxin then becomes an active enzyme which activates ions and water to leave the infected enterocytes, leading to watery diarrhea.

![3D illustration of microscopic Cholera bacteria infection.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/shutterstock_346816784.7757a2b36588072cee54.jpeg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** 3D illustration of microscopic cholera bacteria infection.

There are approximately 4 million patients with cholera in the world every year. Symptoms include vomiting, muscle cramps and profuse diarrhea. Given that the volume of water lost by the body is very large, this causes severe dehydration that can lead to death (approximately 100,000 per year worldwide).

The signs and symptoms of dehydration range from minor to severe and can include:

- Increased thirst
- Dry mouth
- Swelling of brain
- Weakness
- Dizziness
- Palpitations
- Seizures
- Drop in blood pressure
- Fainting
- Decreased urine output
- Kidney failure
- Coma
- Death

Treatment includes the use of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and oral or intravenous rehydration (**Figure 3**).
