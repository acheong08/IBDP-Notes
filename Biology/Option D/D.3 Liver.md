> **Essential idea:** The liver regulates the chemical composition of the blood.

The liver is one of the largest and most important organs in the human body. It is found under the diaphragm in the upper right part of the abdomen. It is in charge of a great number of processes that help in the homeostasis of the body. **Figure 1** shows some of the main functions of the liver.

# Blood supply to the liver

Report feedback on content

The liver is supplied with oxygenated blood from the heart through the **hepatic artery**. This artery is a branch of the aorta. The blood then leaves the liver through the **hepatic vein,** which carries deoxygenated blood. This vein joins the vena cava, which returns the blood to the heart.

![Blood supply to the liver. ](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.1.1%20Blood%20supply%20to%20the%20liver.3cc19954dfc7e673681a.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1**. Blood supply to the liver.

The liver also receives deoxygenated blood coming from the spleen, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder and intestines through the **hepatic portal vein**. This vein carries foods absorbed mainly in the small intestine. It is rich in amino acids, glucose, vitamins, minerals and other foods. The blood supplied by this blood vessel represents the majority of the blood received by the liver (around 75% of the total blood supplied to the liver).

As the liver receives oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery and deoxygenated blood from the hepatic portal vein, we say that the liver has a **dual blood supply**. Because the blood from these two sources is mixed before entering the liver, its cells never receive fully oxygenated blood.

This video by [Armando Hasudungan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCesNt4_Z-Pm41RzpAClfVcg) summarises the liver structure and its blood supply. It also shows how the sinusoids supply blood to the liver cells (hepatocytes) and macrophages (Kupffer cells). These are fully described in the next section.

In the liver, blood from the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein supply the sinusoids that bathe the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. As blood passes through the liver, the hepatocytes monitor the contents of the blood and remove many toxic substances such as alcohol and drugs before they can reach the rest of the body. Enzymes metabolise these toxins to render them harmless.

Many metabolic reactions take place in the liver. These reactions liberate heat, therefore when blood passes through the liver it is warmed up. This helps to maintain the body temperature in warm-blooded organisms.

## Liver lobules

The liver is a triangular shaped organ of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 g consisting of four lobes. The internal structure of each lobe has around 100,000 lobules, each consisting of a central venule coming from the hepatic vein surrounded by six venules coming from the hepatic portal vein and six arterioles from the hepatic artery. These blood vessels are connected by sinusoids (**Figure 1**).

![Structure of a lobule in the liver.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.2.1-Structure-of-a-lobule-in-the-liver.2e592138c36c5c99b671.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Structure of a lobule in the liver.

### **Sinusoids**

**Sinusoids** are tubes that resemble capillaries but have a discontinuous endothelium.

![Capillaries and Sinusoids.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.2.2-Capillaries-and-Sinusoid.d15db2c285ffde870c5e.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Capillaries and sinusoids.

Capillaries and sinusoids are compared and contrasted in **Table 1**.

**Capillaries**

**Sinusoids**

**Table 1.** Differences between capillaries and sinusoids. 

| **Feature** | **Capillaries** | **Sinusoids** |
| Very small pores | Intracellular clefts | Fenestrated (with pores of approximately 175 nm diameter) |
| Continuous basement membrane | Yes | No |
| Cylindrical shape | Yes | No definite shape |
| Smaller | Yes | Larger |
| Little intracellular space | Yes | Large intracellular space |
| Only small molecules can pass | Yes | Leaky |

### Hepatocytes and Kupffer cells

The lobules have mainly two types of cells, hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (as shown in **Figure 1**). **Hepatocytes** perform most of the liver functions, especially storage and metabolism. These cells are large (around 25 μm) and constitute around 80% of the total liver cells. Their nucleus is round and found in the centre of the cell. These cells are capable of regenerating when exposed to toxic substances. Liver regeneration involves the replication of hepatocytes followed by the replication of other liver cells. Once cell proliferation is completed, the newly divided cells undergo restructuring and reformation of the extracellular matrix to complete the process. During regeneration, liver function is only partially affected. Because human liver cells regenerate it has become possible to use partial livers from living donors for transplantation, thereby increasing the number of organs that are available for transplantation.

#### Important

Hepatocytes are involved in many metabolic processes, therefore they are rich in mitochondria, Golgi complexes, rER, ribosomes, glycogen granules and lipid droplets.

**Plasma proteins** are synthesised in hepatocytes mainly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and processed in Golgi complexes. As we have mentioned before, hepatocytes are also involved in the degradation of toxins, such as detoxification of alcohol. Many of the detoxification reactions occur in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER). Hepatocytes also have an exocrine function in the secretion of bile.

#### Be aware

Hepatocytes can have up to 1000 mitochondria and 50 Golgi complexes per cell.

**Kupffer cells** are white blood cells (macrophages) that break down red blood cells. Therefore they are involved in the recycling of erythrocytes, as you will see later in this subtopic. In the lobules there are also canals (bile canaliculi) that carry bile to the **bile duct** that leads to the gall bladder where bile is stored until it is used in the small intestine.

Temporary mounts of liver cells can be prepared from fresh liver tissue and observed under light microscope. This can be done by mashing pieces of liver tissue in a mortar together with 10 ml salt solution. Cells can be stained with a drop of methylene blue before placing the coverslip on the slide. Part of the liver of a mouse under the light microscope is shown in **Figure 3(a)** at a magnification of ×100 and **Figure 3(b)** at ×400.

Now that you know the structure of the liver, in the following sections we are going to study some of its functions.

D.3 Functions of the liver

# Processing and storage of nutrients

Report feedback on content

The liver is in charge of the processing and storage of many nutrients. As you have seen in the previous section, blood enters the liver through the hepatic portal vein. This vein carries most of the food digested and absorbed in the digestive tract.

Hepatocytes in the liver absorb most of the glucose and store it as **glycogen**. When the body requires energy, this glycogen is broken down into glucose.

Fatty acids in the blood passing through the liver are absorbed by hepatocytes and metabolised to produce energy in the form of ATP. Hepatocytes also synthesise lipids such as triglycerides, **cholesterol** and phospholipids. These lipids can be bound to proteins forming lipoproteins, which are now soluble in blood plasma and can therefore be transported in blood to all the body. Much of the cholesterol produced by hepatocytes gets excreted from the body as a component of bile.

**Amino acids** entering the liver are transformed into other amino acids or are used in the synthesis of new proteins. Endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in hepatocytes produce **plasma proteins**. These plasma proteins include fibrinogen used in blood clotting, and albumin that transports hormones and maintains the blood pH.

When amino acids are no longer necessary, hepatocytes remove the amine group from the acid group (deamination). The acid group of the amino acid is used to produce energy or new glucose molecules while the amine group is converted into ammonia. As ammonia is toxic, it is transformed into **urea**, which is then eliminated by the kidneys in urine.

**Figure 1** shows the processing of these molecules in the liver.

![Metabolism of nutrients in the liver.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.3.1%20Metabolism%20of%20nutrients%20in%20the%20liver.139c2713cc85ac133e89.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Metabolism of nutrients in the liver.

A very important function of the liver is **detoxification**. The liver gets rid of drugs, hormones and other toxins. In some cases it breaks down the substances into harmless compounds. If it cannot break them down, it attaches these substances to other organic groups (such a glycine), which allows the kidneys to recognise them as unwanted waste material and are therefore excreted.

The liver is in charge of metabolising **alcohol**. In **Figure 2**, it shows the chemical reactions involved in this process. Ethanol is oxidised into **acetaldehyde**, a toxic substance, by the hepatic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetylaldehyde is converted into a less toxic substance, **acetate**, by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate is then broken down to acetyl-CoA that can enter fatty acid metabolism or be used in the Krebs cycle. If acetaldehyde is not broken down immediately, it can combine with proteins that induce liver injury. Excess of alcohol can damage the liver, causing **cirrhosis**.

![Alcohol detoxification.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.3.2%20Alcohol%20detoxification.946a9f99e30844b9787b.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Alcohol detoxification.

The liver not only stores and processes nutrients, it has other important functions such as the recycling of red blood cells and formation of bile, as you will see in the next sections.

# Recycling erythrocytes and iron

Report feedback on content

Red blood cells or **erythrocytes** are cells modified to increase their capacity in the transport of oxygen. In order to do this, they have a biconcave shape and have lost their nucleus and organelles. These cells are rich in haemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen (as HL students will see in section [haemoglobin and myoglobin](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/hemoglobin-and-myoglobin-id-6025/)). The biconcave shape increases their surface area:volume ratio, thus increasing the absorption of oxygen. The lack of nucleus increases the amount of hemoglobin in each cell. But at the same time this means that they cannot reproduce, therefore they must be produced in the bone marrow from undifferentiated cells.

Erythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and are liberated into the bloodstream. They die after approximately 120 days circulating in blood. Dead erythrocytes are engulfed by macrophages in the liver, spleen or bone marrow by phagocytosis. In the liver, these macrophages are **Kupffer cells**.

#### Important

Kupffer cells recycle dead erythrocytes by phagocytosis.

In the Kupffer cells, the hemoglobin is split into globin chains and heme groups. **Globin** is re-used in protein synthesis. The **heme group** is transformed into iron and bilirubin. **Iron** is carried back to the bone marrow where it is used to produce new red blood cells. **Bilirubin** is secreted into bile that will be used in the emulsification of fats. **Figure 1** shows the function of the liver in the recycling of erythrocytes.

![Recycling of erythrocytes and iron.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.4.1%20Recycling%20of%20erythrocytes%20and%20iron.474915aa9f4cebf54fe8.png?w=900&auto=compress)

**Figure 1 .** Recycling of erythrocytes and iron.

In the next section, you will study how the liver is involved in metabolic functions (formation of cholesterol) and digestive functions (formation of bile salts).

D.3 Functions of the liver

# Cholesterol and bile salts

Report feedback on content

## **Cholesterol**

**Cholesterol** is one of the most well-known fats. You ingest cholesterol in your diet, but it is not essential, as most cholesterol molecules are synthesised in the liver. As most animal cells require cholesterol for membrane synthesis, a small portion is added to the membranes of hepatocytes, and the rest is exported as lipoproteins or bile salts. Cholesterol is also a precursor for other important molecules: the bile salts, steroid hormones (such as oestrogen and progesterone), and vitamin D. Cholesterol synthesis is regulated according to its concentration in cells. This depends on the amount ingested in diet, and the regulation is performed by the hormones glucagon (inactivating its synthesis) and insulin (activating its synthesis).

**Figure 1** shows the structure of cholesterol.

![Cholesterol molecule.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.5.1%20Cholesterol%20molecule.72d7aa408a641097a160.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Cholesterol molecule.

Cholesterol molecules, like triglycerides and phospholipids are insoluble in water. Therefore, to be carried in blood to other tissues, they need to be carried as plasma lipoproteins. Different combinations of lipids and proteins produce particles of different densities. High-density lipoproteins (**HDL**) contain more protein, while low-density lipoproteins (**LDL**) contain more lipids. LDLs and HDLs are both produced in the plasma; however a small amount is synthesised in the liver. The function of LDLs is to transport cholesterol from the liver to other organs. The function of HDLs is to transport cholesterol from tissues to the liver.

Educating the public on scientific claims—scientific studies have shown that high-density lipoprotein could be considered “good” cholesterol.

As you have seen in the [Atherosclerosis](/study/app/ibdp-year-13-biology/sid-47-cid-131289/book/atherosclerosis-id-2796/) section, fats can deposit in arteries causing an atheroma or **plaque**. This is mainly caused by white blood cells (foam cells) and LDL. Molecules of LDL deposit in the blood vessels and can become oxidised. This will cause **atherosclerosis** of the walls of the arteries (**Figure 2**).

![Effect of LDL on blood vessels.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.5.2%20Effect%20of%20LDL%20on%20blood%20vessels.3cb6b5a35083f7831ad8.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Effect of LDL on blood vessels.

#### Exam Tip

Do not confuse atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries due to plaque) with arteriosclerosis (hardening of arteries).

After some time this can cause cardiovascular disease and stroke. If the artery leading to the heart (coronary artery) is clogged, the cells of the heart will not receive enough oxygen and can therefore die. These cells are replaced by fibres causing **coronary heart disease** (CHD). If the artery leading to the head (carotid artery) is affected, this can lead to a brain **stroke**.

#### Be aware

HDL is considered “good” cholesterol as it removes LDL from blood by transporting it to the liver and helps to maintain the endothelium of the blood vessels, thus avoiding coronary heart problems.

## Bile salts

**Bile salts** have a crucial role in digestion as they **emulsify** fats. This means they break fats down into smaller droplets to increase their surface area. This allows enzymes (for example pancreatic lipase) to work better.

Bile salts are synthesised by the liver from surplus cholesterol, and may be modified by bacteria in the intestines. Bile salts are reabsorbed from the intestines into the liver, but lots are lost in faeces. Approximately 600 mg of bile salts are synthesised daily to replace bile acids lost in egestion. Bile salts aid in the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins.

The liver produces about one litre of bile per day. This fluid is carried by the bile canaliculi to the bile duct, which carries it to the gall bladder to be stored. The composition of bile is mainly water (97%), bile salts, cholesterol and fatty acids, bilirubin (from the breakdown of erythrocytes) and inorganic salts.

In the next section, you will learn how liver damage affects the levels of bile and cholesterol.

# Diseases associated with the liver

Report feedback on content

There are many diseases that can affect the function of the liver. These can be caused by pathogens, for example hepatitis virus; metabolic problems; or toxins such as drugs and alcohol. Jaundice is a sign of liver malfunction.

## Jaundice

**Jaundice** is a condition where the skin and white of the eyes turn yellow. It is caused by the presence of **bilirubin** in extracellular fluid. As you have seen before, bilirubin is produced from haemoglobin breakdown in erythrocyte recycling in the liver. The metabolism of haemoglobin accounts for 65% to 80% of the total bilirubin production. Bilirubin in blood binds reversibly to albumin (a plasma protein), forming conjugated bilirubin that travels to the liver, which removes it from the plasma. When the liver is not able to remove the bilirubin from blood, its level may rise (especially in the unconjugated form) and the skin and eyes may begin to appear jaundiced.

Jaundice appears under several circumstances:

- Increased destruction of red blood cells.
- Immaturity in the conjugation of bilirubin (greater in premature babies).
- Genetic diseases (e.g. Gilbert syndrome).
- Defects in the secretion of conjugated bilirubin from hepatocytes (in liver damage).
- Defects in transit of bilirubin to intestines (e.g. with bile duct obstruction).

A high level of bilirubin in the blood is a sign of liver malfunction. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from clinically unnoticeable to severe brain damage and even death. Jaundice is usually a symptom of hepatitis or liver cancer. It can also be caused by the use of drugs, genetic factors, malaria or anemia.

It is common for a baby's bilirubin level to be a bit high after birth as it might take some time for the liver to function properly (**Figure 1**). Some of the causes are a mismatch between the blood type of the mother and the child, lack of certain enzymes, or excess or abnormal blood cells. Special blue lights are used on infants whose bilirubin levels are very high.

![Premature baby being treated by ultraviolet light to solve jaundice issue.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/shutterstock_261126578.2ee263e424b36a4a66fe.jpg?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 1.** Premature baby being treated with ultraviolet light to cure jaundice.

## **Alcohol and cirrhosis**

**Cirrhosis** is a disease where the damaged liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, as shown in **Figure 2**. Not only does this affect the functioning of liver cells, but also interferes with the blood supply to these cells. The symptoms are weakness, fatigue, jaundice and bruising. A liver biopsy will confirm the presence of scars. There is no cure for this disease. A liver transplant can be the solution in extreme cases.

![Normal and cirrhotic liver.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.6.2%20Normal%20and%20cirrhotic%20liver.c95c9bf54acc7d5f0688.png?w=675&auto=compress)

**Figure 2.** Normal and cirrhotic liver.

Excessive alcohol or drug consumption may cause liver cirrhosis. Other causes of cirrhosis include chronic viral hepatitis B or C, chronic bile duct obstruction, fatty liver disease, excess of iron, cystic fibrosis and Wilson’s disease.

The consumption of alcohol has increased worldwide, as shown in **Figure 3**, therefore increasing the amount of deaths due to liver cirrhosis.

![Deaths due to liver cirrhosis per 100,000 people in 2010.](https://kognity-prod.imgix.net/media/edusys_2/content_uploads/15.3.6.3%20Deaths%20due%20to%20liver%20cirrhosis%20per%20100,000%20people%20in%202010.1577ed62f9c4ddcf7103.png?w=900&auto=compress)

The amount of alcohol consumed affects the possibility of liver cirrhosis in a direct manner: the greater the consumption, the greater the chances of dying of liver cirrhosis. The probability of dying of cirrhosis is greater in women than men at lower alcohol consumption, but higher for men at greater alcohol consumption, as shown in **Figure 4**.

**Figure 4.** Increasing amounts of average daily alcohol consumption and relative risk of death from cirrhosis.

#### Theory of Knowledge

Given the poor availability of organs for transplant, do you think an alcoholic should be allowed a liver transplant?

There are many different opinions on to whether alcoholics should or shouldn't receive a transplant. Here are only a few:

Why should alcoholics be entitled to receive a liver transplant?

- Everybody has the right to live.
- They can change their lifestyle and stop drinking.
- They might be the only support for a family.
- Many people care for them.

Why should they not receive a liver transplant?

- They caused the liver damage by their own choice of drinking.
- They must put up with the consequence of their own reckless attitude.
- Other people deserve the transplant more.
- They can relapse back into drinking and damage the new liver.
