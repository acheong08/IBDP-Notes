# A: Define the following terms

1. Current account deficit
    - A current account deficit means the value of imports of goods/services / investment incomes is greater than the value of exports. It is sometimes referred to as a trade deficit.
2. Hot money flows
    - Hot money flows refer to capital flows moving to countries with higher interest rates and/or expected changes in exchange rates.

# B

1. Calculate the change in size of the current account deficit and the value of TL to USD between 2016 and 2018
    - Change in deficit: $(53.3-26.6)/26.6 = 100.38\%$
    - Change in value: $(6.13-3.37)/3.37=81.90\%$
2. State the two components of a nation’s balance of payments
    - Current account
    - Financial account
    - Capital account

- Turkey is spending more on US goods
- Supply of TL increases (shifts right)
- As a result, TL depreciates from 0.30 → 0.16

# D
