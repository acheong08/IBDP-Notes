### Practice question

**Evaluate the view that markets and government intervention should complement each other in developing countries**

The relationship between market-oriented approaches and government intervention in the economic development of developing countries is a multifaceted issue. On one hand, market-oriented approaches, which prioritize the role of the market in allocating resources and driving economic growth, have been associated with increased efficiency and flexibility in the allocation of resources. This, in turn, can lead to increased competitiveness and profitability for firms operating in the market. Additionally, market-oriented approaches often put the needs and wants of consumers at the forefront, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty.

However, government intervention is also seen as necessary for addressing market failures and promoting social and economic stability in developing countries. Market failures, such as externalities and public goods, can lead to inefficiency in the allocation of resources. Government intervention, through the implementation of policies such as taxes, subsidies, and regulations, can help to address these market failures and promote more efficient resource allocation. Additionally, government intervention can be used to provide public goods and services, such as education and healthcare, that would not be provided by the market. Furthermore, government intervention can also be used to promote social and economic stability through policies aimed at reducing inequality and poverty.

Given these strengths and limitations of both market-oriented approaches and government intervention, it can be argued that a combination of the two is necessary for achieving sustainable economic growth in developing countries. The government can create the necessary conditions for market-driven economic growth by investing in infrastructure and education, while also implementing policies to address market failures and promote social and economic stability. This can lead to a more level playing field for businesses and individuals, and ultimately, increased economic growth and development.

In conclusion, the relationship between market-oriented approaches and government intervention in the economic development of developing countries is a complex one. While market-oriented approaches have been associated with increased efficiency and competitiveness, government intervention is necessary for addressing market failures and promoting social and economic stability. By combining the strengths of both market-oriented approaches and government intervention, developing countries can achieve sustainable economic growth and improve the well-being of their citizens.
