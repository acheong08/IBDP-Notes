# Balance of payments

The balance of a country is a record of all transactions between the residents of a country and all foreign countries

- The role of the balance of payments is to show all payments made and received to or from foreign countries.
    - Credit - Payments received
    - Debit - Payments made
- Over a year, the inflows and outflows must be exactly equal
    - `sum(credits) == sum(debits)`
    - `if sum(credits) != sum(debits){error = difference(credits, debits)};`

### Relating the demand and supply of a currency to the balance of payments

- Credits → Foreign demand for domestic currency
- Debits → Supply of domestic currency
