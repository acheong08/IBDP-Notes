# Components of the Balance of Payments

## Current account

### Balance of trade in goods

This is the visible balance, where tangible goods are traded between countries. When a country imports goods, the import expenditure leaves the country and is recorded as a debit on the current account. When a country exports goods, money enters the country and this is recorded as a credit on the current account.

### Balance of trade in services

This is the invisible balance, consisting of the balance of trade of legal services, hospitality, consultancy, and so on. This sector is a major earner for developed nations for a number of reasons. As countries grow and develop, they move away from primary and secondary industries towards tertiary industries that have the ability to generate large amounts of surplus value. In turn, these countries provide these same services to those countries that have yet to develop a sophisticated service sector.

### Income

Income refers to the factor payments for the factors of production. You might own property in another country and receive rent that is credited to the current account of the country you live in. This component also includes investment income in the form of, for example, dividend payments when you own shares of a company. It is not the same as when the purchase of an asset is made, which is covered by the financial account, but refers to only the income derived from owning that asset, such as earning interest on bonds.

### Current transfers

A transfer on the current account refers to a payment between one government and another that is **not** in exchange for any good or service. An example is foreign aid.

### Capital transfers

Capital transfers consist of transactions involving transfers of ownership of fixed assets, transfers of funds linked to the buying and selling of fixed assets, or debt forgiveness.

### Transaction in non-produced, non-financial assets

Non-produced assets largely cover intangibles, such as patented entities, leases or other transferable contracts, and payments of goodwill. For example, a lease is a contractual arrangement between a landlord and a tenant. A company in country A can sell a lease that it owns to another company in country B. This will be recorded as a credit on country A's capital account and a debit on country B's capital account.

## Financial accounts

### Foreign direct investment

Foreign direct investment is the purchase of a firm, or part of a firm, by a firm from another country. When companies do this, they become multinational corporations. When only part of a firm is bought, it must be at least 10% of the shares of the company to be considered a foreign direct investment.

### Portfolio investment

Portfolio investment refers to the purchase and sale of financial capital. This includes shares, bonds, derivatives, the trading of commodities and currencies. This only considers the transfer of funds when a purchase is made, not the income derived from that investment (such as dividends from owning shares, which is included under the current account).

### Reserves assets

These are the foreign currency held by the central banks. These should include paper money, deposits, government bonds and securities.

### Official borrowing

Official borrowing occurs when the government borrows (debit) or lends (a credit item) money from the IMF, World Bank, or the government of another country.
