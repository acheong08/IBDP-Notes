# Interdependence between the accounts

# Zero Balance

- In the balance of payments, the sum of all items is always zero
- The sum of all credits always balances with the sum of all debits
- Deficits are matched by surpluses

## Why

- All credits create demand for a currency
- All debits create a supply of a currency
- Exchange rates are determined by currency demand and supply
- At the point where currency demand equals currency supply, the sum of credits is equal to the sum of debits

# Interdependence

## Current account

### Deficit

- $consumption > production$

- Paid for via financial account surplus
    - Loans

### Surplus

- $consumption < production$
- Sale of extra output corresponds to financial account
    - Investment in foreign countries

# Imbalance

Balance of payments excluding central bank intervention (Reserve assets)

Central bank forces a balance
