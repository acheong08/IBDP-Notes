# Landlocked countries

- Lack of access to fishing and oceanic food sources
- High transportation and transit costs because of a lack of access to ports and world shipping operations
- Geopolitical vulnerabilities from dependence on neighbouring countries for access to world markets and natural resources
- Military limitations because of the lack of naval options
    - Further economic vulnerability to the whims of neighbours

# **Shipping (What they are losing out on)**

- Allows countries to access the raw materials needed to develop their economies.
- Enables the manufacture and export of affordable goods and products.
- Has the lowest environmental footprint in the transport segment on a per-ton basis.

> **The Regional Coordinator of the International Maritime Organisation for West and Central Sub-region of Africa has disclosed that over 90 percent of the worldâ€™s trade is carried out by sea.**
