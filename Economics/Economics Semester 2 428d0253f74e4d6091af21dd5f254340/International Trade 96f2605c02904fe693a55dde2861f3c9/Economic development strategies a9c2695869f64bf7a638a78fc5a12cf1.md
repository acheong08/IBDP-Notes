# Diversification

Diversification involves a reallocation of resources into new activities that broaden the range of goods or services produced

- Most suitable to high income developing countries
- Primary sector → secondary sector → tertiary sector
- GDP = `C+G+I+(E-M)`
- More varied exports
- Value added production refers to the value of a good that is added in each step of a production process
    - Engage in more varied production activities
    - Creating employment opportunities
    - Establishing new firms involved in manufacturing
    - Activities requiring higher skill and technology

****************Benefits****************

- Sustained increase in exports
- Development of technological capacity
- Reduced vulnerability to short-term price volatility
- Use of domestic primary commodities

# Market based policies

# Inward foreign direct investment

- Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to investments made by foreign companies or individuals into a domestic economy.
    - Control at least 10 percent of the firm
    - Separate legal entity to avoid lawsuits
- This can take the form of building new facilities, buying existing companies, or investing in domestic companies through equity or debt.
- Inward FDI can bring a number of benefits to the host economy, such as job creation, technology transfer, and access to new markets.
- Inward FDI can also have negative effects, such as increased competition for domestic companies and potential loss of control over strategic industries.
- Governments may use various policies to attract inward FDI, such as tax incentives, investment guarantees, and relaxed regulations, but these policies also have its own set of pros and cons.
- Inward FDI can be measured in different ways, including stock, flow and as a percentage of GDP
- It's also can be categorized as Greenfield investment and Merger and acquisition (M&A)
- Different industries have different levels of attractiveness to inward FDI, depending on factors such as the level of economic development, the strength of the domestic market, and the availability of natural resources.

## Why do MNCs expand into less economically developed countries?

- Multinational corporations (MNCs) often expand into less economically developed countries in order to take advantage of their lower labor costs and to access new markets.
- Other factors that may lead MNCs to expand into less economically developed countries include access to natural resources, preferential trade agreements, and tax incentives.
- MNCs may also expand into less economically developed countries as a way to diversify their portfolio of investments and to spread their risk.
- MNCs may be attracted to less economically developed countries due to their lower level of regulation and their improved infrastructure in recent years.

### Points of attraction

- Lower labor costs:
    - Inward FDI can take advantage of lower labor costs in the host country to lower production costs and increase competitiveness.
    - This can be done through setting up new factories or outsourcing production to local companies.
    - Lower labor costs can also be a result of lower wages, less stringent labor regulations, or a weaker currency.
- Access to new markets:
    - Foreign companies may invest in a host country in order to gain access to new markets for their products or services.
    - This can include expanding into new geographic regions or tapping into new customer segments.
    - The host country may also have established trade agreements or preferential market access, which can make it easier for the foreign company to export its products.
- Access to natural resources:
    - Inward FDI may also be attracted to countries with abundant natural resources, such as minerals, oil and gas, or agricultural land.
    - The foreign company may look to control or exploit these resources, either directly or through partnerships with local firms.
    - The resources may be imported or exported to another countries.
- Preferential trade agreements:
    - A country with preferential trade agreements in place with other countries may be more attractive to foreign investors looking to access those markets.
    - These agreements can lower tariffs and other trade barriers, making it easier and cheaper for the foreign company to export its products or services.
    - Some agreements may also provide for greater intellectual property protection or investment guarantees.
- Tax incentives:
    - Governments may offer various tax incentives to attract foreign investment, such as reduced corporate tax rates or special tax holidays.
    - Tax exemptions may also be offered for specific types of investments, such as research and development or investments in certain sectors.
    - These incentives can make the host country a more attractive destination for foreign investment.
- Diversification and risk management:
    - Inward FDI can also be used as a tool for diversifying a company's operations and managing risk, by investing in different geographic regions or industries.
    - The foreign company may look to spread its operations across multiple countries or regions in order to reduce the impact of political or economic instability in any one location.
    - It may also invest in different industry sectors to reduce its exposure to any one market or industry.
- Lower levels of regulation:
    - Some companies may be attracted to countries with lower levels of regulation, which can make it easier and cheaper to do business.
    - This can include less restrictive labor laws, fewer environmental regulations, or fewer rules governing business practices.
    - This can also include less bureaucracy and more efficient government services.
- Improved infrastructure:
    - A country with well-developed infrastructure may be more attractive to foreign investors, as it can lower the costs of transportation and communications.
    - This can include good quality roads, ports, airports, and telecommunications networks.
    - Improved infrastructure can also facilitate the movement of goods and people, making it easier for the foreign company to conduct business in the host country.

# Example exam question

Discuss how minimum wage can be used to redistribute income. (10 marks)

Introduction:
Minimum wage refers to the minimum amount that employers are legally required to pay their employees. It is a policy tool that governments use to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage and to reduce income inequality.

Body 1 - Positive:
One argument in favor of using minimum wage as a means of redistributing income is that it can directly benefit low-income workers. By setting a minimum wage above the poverty line, governments can ensure that workers are able to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. This can help to reduce income inequality and poverty rates.

Another argument in favor of minimum wage is that it can lead to a positive ripple effect on the economy. When low-income workers receive a higher wage, they are more likely to spend their extra income on goods and services, which can boost demand and stimulate economic growth. This can ultimately lead to an increase in employment opportunities and higher wages for all workers.

Body 2 - Negative:
However, there are also arguments against using minimum wage as a means of redistributing income. One argument is that it can lead to job loss for low-skilled workers. When the minimum wage is increased, employers may choose to cut jobs or automate certain tasks in order to offset the increased labor costs. This can disproportionately affect low-skilled workers, who may have a harder time finding employment.

Another argument against minimum wage is that it can lead to price increases for goods and services. When the cost of labor increases, businesses may choose to pass on these costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can negatively impact the purchasing power of all consumers, including those who are benefitting from the higher minimum wage.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while minimum wage can be an effective tool for redistributing income and reducing poverty, it also has the potential to have negative consequences. It is important for governments to carefully consider the potential trade-offs and to find the right balance in setting the minimum wage.
