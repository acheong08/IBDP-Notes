## Trade Creation

Trade creation refers tot the situation where higher cost products are replaced by lower cost imports after the formation of a trading bloc

The removal of trade barriers offered the opportunity to replace higher cost goods with lower cost imports from members of the trade bloc

The total demand increased by joining a trade bloc

## Trade Diversion

Trade diversion refers to the situation where lower cost imports are replaced by higher cost imports from a member after the formation of the trading bloc.

Trade diversion occurs when an importing country is forced to import from a higher cost producer within a trading bloc, whereas before joining the trading bloc, it was importing from a lower cost producer elsewhere.
