# Foreign Exchange

The international transactions involves the use of different national currencies

- Affected by supply and demand
    - Demand for foreign currencies generates a supply of domestic currency
    - Demand for domestic currency generates a supply of foreign currencies

# Exchange rates

Exchange rate is the value of once currency to another

(Focus on buying rate)

Calculation: ÷ or ×

### Why do countries want the currency of another country?

- Purchase foreign goods (imports)
- Investment

## Floating

- Determined by market forces
- No government intervention

## Fixed

## Managed

# Determination

(Relative)

## Depreciation

A fall in the value of a currency in a floating exchange rate system

- Decrease in the demand of the currency
- Increase in the supply of the currency

## Appreciation

A rise the in the value of a currency in a floating exchange rate system

- Increase in demand
- Decrease in supply

# Valuation of Managed and Fixed currencies

## Overvalued

### Definition

`currency_value > actual_value`

### Positive consequences

- Overvaluation means that imports are cheaper in the local currency. This can be crucial for import-dependent populations or where basic necessities (e.g., food, medicines, energy) in emerging countries have to be imported for the local market.
- Overvaluation also increases political stability. To the extent that imports of basic necessities are handled or subsidized by the country’s government, the political consequences of allowing devaluation (i.e., reducing overvaluation) would be detrimental to the ruling regime. This is because—following a devaluation—basic necessities may still have to be imported anyway, costing more in the local currency. This may lead to protests against the government.
- In some cases, keeping a currency overvalued puts a damper on local inflation. Especially in import-dependent economies, importing at the overvalued exchange rate is cheaper than local production, keeping price increases under control.

### Negative consequences

- Overvaluation may hurt or reduce exports because companies converting their foreign currency earnings (e.g., USD) at the overvalued exchange rate do not earn enough local currency (e.g., rupees [Rs]) to justify their costs.
- Overvaluation also means imports appear artificially cheap compared with local substitute products, thereby dampening investments and jobs in the sectors that could produce locally to compete against imports.
- Foriegn coming into a country with an overvaluated currency is somewhat reduced because foreign currencies (e.g., USD) convert into fewer units of local currency (e.g., Rs) with which to buy assets such as land, factories, and so forth.

## Undervalued

### Positive consequences

- Undervaluation gives a boost to China’s exporters because the dollars they earn convert into more RMB than they would otherwise.
- Undervaluation also makes foreign direct investment (FDI) more attractive to outside investors, since their currencies, say the US dollar (USD), convert into more RMB with which to buy land, factories, or any local asset. The cost of establishing FDI in China is reduced, in say dollar terms, thereby boosting FDI in China from the rest of the world.
- The expectation of consistent future undervaluation by the PBoC has caused investment and jobs to pour into China’s export sector, turning it into the “Factory of the World.”
- Undervaluation makes imports coming into China more expensive in RMB, thereby protecting domestic Chinese firms from import competition and retaining investment and jobs in the country.
- Overall, an undervalued currency boosts investment and jobs—something critical in a population of 1.4 billion people.

### Negative consequences

- Effective protection against imports through undervaluation means reduced competition, which could also make local firms less competitive.
- In a country with a limited labor supply, the excess demand for jobs could escalate wages, which in turn could increase inflation in general. (This did not happen in China for many decades because of its large population. However, with the one-child policy finally having an effect starting in 2015, labor shortages are now being seen: Chinese labor costs have escalated sharply, threatening China’s “Factory of the World” position.)
