# Fixed exchange rate

Exchange rates are fixed by a government or central bank, and are not permitted to change in response to change in currency supply and demand.

It will usually tie a country’s official exchange rate to another country’s currency or the price of gold

# Devaluation and revaluation of a currency

Devaluation is when the value of a nation’s currency falls, relative to other currencies as a result of deliberate policy decision by the government or central bank

Revaluation is when the value of a nation’s currency rises relative to other countries due to a deliberate policy decision by the government or central bank

# How fixed exchange rates are maintained

## Supply management

- The shift from S to S₁ can be achieved by
    
    → Limiting imports to reduce the supply
    
    → Imposing exchange controls (Limits)
    

## Intervention

### Using official reserves to maintain the exchange rate

- When there is an excess supply of the currency, the central bank intervenes to buy the excess currency by selling some of its foreign currency reserves
- If there is an excess demand for demand, the central bank will sell its domestic currency by buying more foreign currency
- Both strategies can maintain the fixed exchange rate
    - However, foreign currency reserves are limited

### Changes in interest rates

- Increasing interest rate → Attracts financial investments from other countries
    - Increases demand for domestic currency
- Might lead to recession
    - Consumers save more
    - Firms borrow less

### Borrowing from abroad

- Loans from overseas increase the demand for domestic currency
- Costly and has interest

### Efforts to limit imports

- Limiting imports will reduce the supply of the domestic currency.
- This can be achieved by either:
    - Trade protection
        - Link drawbacks
    - Contractionary fiscal and monetary policies
        - Possibility of recession

### Imposing exchange controls

- Exchange controls are restrictions imposed by the government on the quantity of foreign exchange that can be bought by domestic residents of a country
- Will cause resource misallocation

## Explain the main differences between fixed and floating exchange rate systems

An exchange rate regime is generally defined as the way in which a country, or several countries, determine the exchange rate of their currency in relation to others. Though it was previously widespread, the currencies of most developed countries are no longer governed by a fixed exchange rate system. The floating exchange rate regime, also known as the flexible exchange rate regime, is the most prevalent exchange rate regime today. There are two main types of exchange rate regime

With floating exchange rate systems, there is no specific exchange rate target. The currency rate fluctuates freely in accordance with supply and demand on the foreign exchange 
market.

The currency rate of fixed exchange rate systems is set to a particular standard (typically another currency or a basket of currencies). The currency rate is, however, allowed to fluctuate within a narrow range of this benchmark or standard.

- Level of certainty
    - Fixed exchange rate is more stable
    - Exchange rate is tied
- Government intervention → Foreign exchange market
