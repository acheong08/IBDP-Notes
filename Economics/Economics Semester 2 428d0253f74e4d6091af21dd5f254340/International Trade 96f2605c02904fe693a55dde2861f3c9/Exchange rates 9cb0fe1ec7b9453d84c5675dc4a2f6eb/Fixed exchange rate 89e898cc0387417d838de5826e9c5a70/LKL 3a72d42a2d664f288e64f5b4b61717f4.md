## Fixed exchange rate

- Controlled by central bank via reserve assets
- Government intervention via Official borrowing

## Managed exchange rate

- Closely linked to floating exchange rate
- Periodic intervention

## Floating exchange rate

- Would not have reserve assets
- No official borrowing
- It is not a floating exchange rate

Due to the presence of intervention in the financial account, it is impossible for it to be a true floating exchange rate system. However, it is possible that it is a managed exchange rate with periodic intervention. This brings it closer to a floating exchange rate.
