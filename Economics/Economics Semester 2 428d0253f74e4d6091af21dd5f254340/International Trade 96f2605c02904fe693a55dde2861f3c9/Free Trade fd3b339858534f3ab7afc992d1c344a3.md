# Free Trade

The absence of government intervention of any kind in international trade. There are thus no trade restrictions between individuals or firms in different countries.

### Diagrams

**Production Possibility Curve**

- Maximum of each product (two points)
- Straight line

**P&C no trade**

- Units of each product divided by two

**P&C with trade**

- Export $1/2$ of products with absolute advantage (Use lower end)
- Total production outside of P.P.C.

# Absolute Advantage

The ability of one country to produce a good using fewer resources than another

- A special case of comparative advantage

## Arguments derived

- Countries should specialise in the good in which they have an absolute advantage. The result is thus higher efficiency, production, and consumption
- Leads to global reallocation of resources based on efficiency (low-cost)

# Comparative Advantage

Refers to the situation where one nation has a lower opportunity cost in the production of a good than another country

## Determining which country has a comparative advantage

- “The country that has the more aligned P.P.C has an comparative advantage on the aligned axis”

## Theory

- Specialisation according to comparative advantage, global production and consumption will increase because  of an improvement in the global allocation of resources
- Parallel lines means that trade is unnecessary for the two nations

# Sources of advantages

- Factors of production
    - Education
    - Skills
- Capital
    - Technology
    - Machines
- Land
    - Natural resources
    - Climate
    - Geography

# Discussion

| Benefits | Limitations |
| --- | --- |
| Basis of trade policy in many countries | Depends on impractical assumptions (No change) |
| Global production and consumption | Transportation ignored |
| Improved global allocation of resources | Specialisation may prevent necessary structural changes |
| Removal of trade restrictions | May lead to excessive specialisation: Dependencies |
