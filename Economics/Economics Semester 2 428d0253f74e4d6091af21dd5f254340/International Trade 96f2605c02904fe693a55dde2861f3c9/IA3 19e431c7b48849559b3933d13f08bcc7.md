# China Loans Pakistan $10bn for Railway Upgrade

[Pakistan taps Chinese credit for railway upgrade despite debt crisis](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1027242-pakistan-taps-chinese-credit-for-railway-upgrade-despite-debt-crisis)

## **Overview**

- Pakistan and China have agreed to a $10bn revamp of Pakistan's 1,700km railway line, called Main Line 1 (ML1).
- The project aims to increase train speeds on the route and is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
- Some analysts are concerned about the impact of borrowing billions more for the project on Pakistan's already high debt levels.

## **ML1 Upgrade Details**

- The ML1 railway connects Karachi to Lahore and the capital, Islamabad.
- The project includes track replacement, signaling modernization, level crossing conversions, and fence construction to prevent cattle crossings.

## **Cost and Funding**

- The ML1 upgrade is estimated to cost a total of $60bn.
- Pakistan will fund the project with a loan from China, repayable over 20 to 25 years and described as "concessional" by Pakistan's Planning Minister, Ahsan Iqbal.

## **Debt Concerns**

- Pakistan owes around $100bn in external debt to lenders including the World Bank and China.
- A drop in foreign exchange reserves has raised concerns about the risk of default.
- Some analysts argue that taking on more debt for the ML1 project is an example of the kind of borrowing decisions that have led to economic crises in Pakistan in the past.

## **Justification for the Project**

- Pakistan's Planning Minister argues that the ML1 upgrade is necessary to keep the railway system functioning and is an example of the transformative work made possible by Chinese credit.
- The project is expected to take 6 to 9 years to complete and will be implemented in phases to make it more manageable, with an initial cost of $3bn.

## **International Relations Implications**

- The ML1 upgrade is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
- A western diplomat in Islamabad suggested that the continued development of such projects despite financial distress in other BRI recipient countries reflects the importance China places on its relationship with Pakistan.
- Chinese state lenders, including China Development Bank and China Exim Bank, are among the largest creditors to Pakistan, accounting for around $30bn of the country's outstanding debt.

## **Alternative Funding Options**

- Pakistan is also seeking funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help stabilize its shrinking reserves.
- The finance ministry is in talks with the IMF to secure the next tranche of a $7bn assistance program and has said it will approach "friendly" countries for additional support.
- Some analysts have suggested that Pakistan should consider alternative financing options, such as issuing Islamic bonds or seeking assistance from the Gulf Cooperation Council.

There isn't any more information in the article beyond what I've already summarized. However, I can provide some additional context or clarification if there are any specific points you'd like to know more about. Just let me know!

## Possible arguments

1. The ML1 upgrade could have a positive economic impact on Pakistan by improving transportation infrastructure and increasing trade. By allowing for faster and more efficient transport of goods and people, the upgrade could boost economic growth and development in the country.
2. On the other hand, taking on more debt to fund the project could have negative consequences for Pakistan's financial stability. With already high levels of external debt, there is a risk that the additional borrowing could put further strain on the country's finances and increase the risk of default.
3. The project could also have geopolitical implications, as it is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Some analysts may argue that the project reflects the strong and strategic relationship between China and Pakistan, while others may see it as evidence of China's influence and potential debt trap diplomacy.
4. Another argument could be that alternative financing options, such as seeking assistance from other countries or issuing Islamic bonds, could have been more suitable for Pakistan given its financial constraints.
