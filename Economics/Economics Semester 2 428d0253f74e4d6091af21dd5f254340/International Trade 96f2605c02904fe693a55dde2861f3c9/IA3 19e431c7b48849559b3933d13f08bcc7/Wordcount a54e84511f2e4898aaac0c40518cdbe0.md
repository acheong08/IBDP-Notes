**IBDP Economics HL Internal Assessment**

Pakistan's borrowing of $10 billion for an infrastructure project, M1L, from China, despite the country being in a debt crisis of over $100 billion. It also mentions the impact of the project on the Pakistani economy, such as the revival of the colonial-era railway network, the increase in train speeds, and the potential to use the railway for logistics. However, the article also touches on the potential risks of taking on more debt, as it could lead to defaulting in the future. Furthermore, the article discusses the foreign aid that the country is seeking from the IMF and other countries to help stabilize its shrinking foreign reserves.

The economy of Pakistan is impacted by the infrastructural developments resulting from the utilization of $10 billion in loan funds obtained from China. This injection of funds into the economy stimulates demand as employment opportunities arise in the construction sector and among businesses supplying materials for the project. The increase in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve from AD1 to AD2, leading to an increase in the price level and a corresponding rise in real output from Y1 to Y2. The improved railway network enhances the efficiency of transportation and logistics, causing a shift in the LRAS from LRAS1 to LRAS2, which results in a decrease in the price level and a further increase in real output from Y2 to Y3. The economy therefore attains a more efficient and sustainable level of output with relatively low inflation.

However, there are risks associated with taking on more debt. The article mentions the possibility of defaulting in the future and the need for foreign aid to stabilize the shrinking foreign reserves. An increase in the level of debt could lead to an increase in interest rates, resulting in a decrease in investment and net exports and thus a decrease in the AD curve. This would cause a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. If the increase in debt is not offset by an increase in foreign reserves, this could lead to a liquidity crisis and potentially a default.

However, there are risks associated with taking on more debt. The article mentions the possibility of defaulting in the future and the need for foreign aid to stabilize the shrinking foreign reserves. An increase in the level of debt could lead to an increase in interest rates, resulting in a decrease in investment and net exports and thus a decrease in the AD curve. This would cause a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. If the increase in debt is not offset by an increase in foreign reserves, this could lead to a liquidity crisis and potentially a default. The risk of default depends on the successfulness of the infrastructure project in generating returns and the ability of the government to manage debt repayments.

This risk can be mitigated through careful management of the project and prudent fiscal policies. Additionally, the country must ensure that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt.

The borrowing of $10 billion from China for the M1L infrastructure project in Pakistan is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can lead to an increase in economic activity and a more efficient transportation network, which can lead to an increase in real output and a decrease in inflation. On the other hand, taking on more debt can lead to an increase in interest rates, which can decrease investment and net exports, leading to a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. The risk of default can be mitigated through careful management of the project and prudent fiscal policies, as well as ensuring that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt. It is important for the government to weigh the potential benefits and risks before making a decision on borrowing more funds.

In conclusion, the $10 billion loan from China for the M1L infrastructure project in Pakistan has the potential to bring about positive economic impacts, such as increased economic activity, a more efficient transportation network, and an increase in real output. However, it also brings with it the risk of default and an increase in interest rates, which can decrease investment and net exports, leading to a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. The government must carefully consider the potential benefits and risks before making a decision on borrowing more funds and must ensure that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt.
