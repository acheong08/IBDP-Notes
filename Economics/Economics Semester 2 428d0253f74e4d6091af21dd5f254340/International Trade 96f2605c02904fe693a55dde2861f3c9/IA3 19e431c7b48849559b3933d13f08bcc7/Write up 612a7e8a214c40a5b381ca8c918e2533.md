Pakistan taps Chinese credit for railway upgrade despite debt crisis
By News Desk January 05, 2023
Islamabad/New Delhi: Since the 19th century, Pakistan’s clattering railways have carried passengers and cargo from the Arabian Sea to the Himalayas. But the colonial-era network is in severe disrepair, with decrepit trains and some tracks left unusable by devastating flooding last year.

Together with its close ally China, Pakistan is now preparing at least a partial solution: a $10 billion revamp of its 1,700km arterial Main Line 1 railway to be paid for with loans from Beijing, FT reported.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Xi Jinping agreed in November to begin work on the line, which links the southern port city of Karachi to Lahore and the capital, Islamabad. The project is expected to increase maximum train speeds on the route to 160kph.

But the ML1 upgrade has raised questions about whether heavily indebted Pakistan should be borrowing billions of dollars more for expensive infrastructure at a time of severe financial strain.

Some analysts believe Pakistan, which owes about $100 billion in external debt to lenders including the World Bank and China, is at risk of defaulting after a plunge in its foreign exchange reserves.

Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s planning minister, said the ML1 upgrade was vital to keep trains running and an example of the transformative work that Chinese credit had made possible.

“If we do not undertake this project, in a couple of years Pakistan will lose its railway logistics,” Iqbal told the Financial Times.

“The whole railway system will break down, this main line will break down. It will be very risky to run commercial operations on this track. It is no longer a choice. It is an imperative.”

But critics said taking on more debt for the ML1 project was an example of the kind of bad borrowing decisions that had led Pakistan into successive economic crises in recent years. Pakistan’s foreign reserves have sunk to below $6 billion, or equivalent to less than one month of imports.

Iqbal, who oversees Pakistan’s involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s international infrastructure scheme, said it would take six to nine years to complete the ML1 upgrade. The work will include replacing track, modernising signalling, converting level crossings into underpasses or flyovers and building fences to stop cattle crossing the line.

The planning minister said the project would proceed in phases “to make it more manageable”, with an initial cost of $3 billion. The loan from China would be repayable over 20 to 25 years and would be “concessional”, he said, without providing further details.

The ML1 upgrade is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a BRI centrepiece with an estimated total cost of $60bn. The CPEC also includes Chinese development of a deep-sea port at Gwadar in south-western Pakistan, among other projects.

A western diplomat in Islamabad said that for such projects to have continued even as Beijing saw growing financial distress in BRI recipient countries pointed to the importance it put on ties with Pakistan.

“Even if the rest [of BRI] lags behind, China wants to stay the course with Pakistan,” the diplomat said, adding that the relationship had “important military aspects developed over the long term”.

Projects such as ML1 have also fuelled analyst concerns over whether excessive Chinese lending is exacerbating strains on Pakistan’s precarious finances. Chinese state lenders are together among the largest creditors to Islamabad, accounting for about $30bn of its outstanding debt.

Sakib Sherani of advisory firm Macro Economic Insights said it was unfair to single out China’s role in Pakistan’s debt woes, with the largest repayments in the current financial year actually due to multilateral lenders.

Even as it taps Beijing for the ML1 project, Pakistan is looking elsewhere for funds to help stabilise its shrinking reserves. The finance ministry is in talks with the IMF to secure the next tranche of a $7 billion assistance programme, and has said it will approach “friendly” countries such as Saudi Arabia for more loans.

Sharif’s government is betting it can steady the economy in time for parliamentary elections that must be held before the end of this year.

Iqbal said he was confident the country would pull through. “Pakistan is facing economic [and] fiscal difficulties, but it is not in the range that it is a default economy yet. We are managing very prudently.”

Pakistan's borrowing of $10 billion for an infrastructure project, M1L, from China, despite the country being in a debt crisis of over $100 billion. It also mentions the impact of the project on the Pakistani economy, such as the revival of the colonial-era railway network, the increase in train speeds, and the potential to use the railway for logistics. However, the article also touches on the potential risks of taking on more debt, as it could lead to defaulting in the future. Furthermore, the article discusses the foreign aid that the country is seeking from the IMF and other countries to help stabilize its shrinking foreign reserves.

The economy of Pakistan is impacted by the infrastructural developments resulting from the utilization of $10 billion in loan funds obtained from China. This injection of funds into the economy stimulates demand as employment opportunities arise in the construction sector and among businesses supplying materials for the project. The increase in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve from AD1 to AD2, leading to an increase in the price level and a corresponding rise in real output from Y1 to Y2. The improved railway network enhances the efficiency of transportation and logistics, causing a shift in the LRAS from LRAS1 to LRAS2, which results in a decrease in the price level and a further increase in real output from Y2 to Y3. The economy therefore attains a more efficient and sustainable level of output with relatively low inflation.

However, there are risks associated with taking on more debt. The article mentions the possibility of defaulting in the future and the need for foreign aid to stabilize the shrinking foreign reserves. An increase in the level of debt could lead to an increase in interest rates, resulting in a decrease in investment and net exports and thus a decrease in the AD curve. This would cause a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. If the increase in debt is not offset by an increase in foreign reserves, this could lead to a liquidity crisis and potentially a default.

This would cause a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. If the increase in debt is not offset by an increase in foreign reserves, this could lead to a liquidity crisis and potentially a default. The risk of default depends on the successfulness of the infrastructure project in generating returns and the ability of the government to manage debt repayments.

This risk can be mitigated through careful management of the project and prudent fiscal policies. Additionally, the country must ensure that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt.

The borrowing of $10 billion from China for the M1L infrastructure project in Pakistan is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can lead to an increase in economic activity and a more efficient transportation network, which can lead to an increase in real output and a decrease in inflation. On the other hand, taking on more debt can lead to an increase in interest rates, which can decrease investment and net exports, leading to a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. The risk of default can be mitigated through careful management of the project and prudent fiscal policies, as well as ensuring that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt. It is important for the government to weigh the potential benefits and risks before making a decision on borrowing more funds.

In conclusion, the $10 billion loan from China for the M1L infrastructure project in Pakistan has the potential to bring about positive economic impacts, such as increased economic activity, a more efficient transportation network, and an increase in real output. However, it also brings with it the risk of default and an increase in interest rates, which can decrease investment and net exports, leading to a decrease in real output and an increase in the price level. The government must carefully consider the potential benefits and risks before making a decision on borrowing more funds and must ensure that foreign aid is used to raise foreign reserves and not to finance more public debt.
