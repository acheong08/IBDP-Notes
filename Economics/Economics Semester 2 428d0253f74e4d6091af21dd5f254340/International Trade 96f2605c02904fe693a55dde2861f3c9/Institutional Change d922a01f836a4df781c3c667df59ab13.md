## Microfinance

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Provides access to credit for those who may not qualify for traditional loans | Interest rates can be high |
| Can help individuals start or expand small businesses | Repayment can be difficult for those with irregular income |
| Can improve financial inclusion and empowerment | Can lead to over-indebtedness if not managed properly |
| Can stimulate economic growth in underdeveloped areas | Can be difficult to monitor and regulate |

Note: Microfinance is a complex field and these are general advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the context and implementation, the balance of advantages and disadvantages may vary.

### Case study: Indonesia

Indonesia has had relative success in the microfinance industry in comparison to other countries where microloan borrowers have been driven to suicide by relentless loan sharks. The industry has been criticized for being unregulated, leading to over indebtedness and profiting from high interest rates imposed on borrowers. However, in a KPMG report on Indonesia’s microfinance, it was noted that authorities have taken concrete steps in ensuring microloans are distributed prudently to borrowers and to prevent unscrupulous lenders from exploiting their clients. Regulators like the Indonesian financial authority Otoritas Jasa Keuanga (OJK) are determined to track the number of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in an effort to map the landscape and develop a legal framework for these institutions. Despite efforts, the report highlighted that 203 million, or 81.5% of Indonesians are at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and still need access to financial services in order to improve their lives and communities.

**************Statistics:**************

- Indonesia has a large scale microfinance sector, with a range of commercial banks and over 60,000 MFIs reaching more than 50 million people (CGAP).
- As of 2013, there were $11.2 billion USD loans disbursed, 722,249 borrowers and $13.1 billion USD in deposits (MIX Market).
- Indonesia has more than 50 million MSMEs, representing some 97% of all enterprises and contributing no less than 30% of GDP growth in 2012 (OECD).
- Many of these MSMEs do not have adequate access to the bank financing they need to grow their businesses, particularly in rural areas.
- Bank Indonesia issued a rule that requires banks to have at least 20% of their loan portfolio dedicated to microloans by 2018.
- 260 million mobile subscribers in Indonesia, with 143 million unique mobile subscribers enabling the poorest people to have access to reliable financial transactions.
- Diverse banking sector in Indonesia, with regulated banks being either general commercial banks (Bank Umum) or Bank Perkreditan Rakyats (BPRs).
- BTPN has been expanding into microfinance since a buyout by the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2008, followed by loan financing from the IFC in 2009 and 2012.
- Sumitomo-Mitsui Financial Group announced in 2013 that it plans to acquire a 24% stake of BTPN at a 14% premium to its last traded price pre-announcement and is looking to acquire up to 40% for about $1.5 billion pending regulatory approval.
- BRI has long been dominant in the microfinance space, but now, BRI’s position is being challenged by a range of competitors, such as Bank Mandiri and Bank Danamon.
- Lending regulations (which require customers to have proof of a permanent job, income and collateral) shut out the majority of Indonesia’s laborers.
- A combination of strict regulations and too-high thresholds have hampered efforts and given rise to a murky black-market of motorcycle-riding lenders and unscrupulous loan sharks.
- Inadequate outreach to rural communities has also contributed to unmet demand. Most micro lending has been located in the urban areas of Java and Sumatra, where the Indonesian population is concentrated.
- Microfinance operations need to cover its operational costs by ensuring that there is ample customer base to spread its expenditures and that it is located closer to the customers’ homes and workplaces.
- The emergence of mobile banking has been gaining attention as a new delivery model that addresses cost barriers and enables reaching more under-served communities.
