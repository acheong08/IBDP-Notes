# Detailed Research

## Resource allocation

With international trade, resources are allocated more efficiently. Shortages and surplus can be made up for through exports and imports. This also allows nations to specialise in producing goods and services they have a comparative advantage at. Production volume can thus increase as they are optimised by their available factors of production. There are numerous examples of this effect: China’s manufacturing industry optimised by cheap labour, US’s “Big Tech” companies through anti-competitive oppression via politics (TikTok ban etc.), and the Middle East’s oligopoly on fossil fuels. 

## Talent loss / Industry loss (Unfair distribution of benefits)

Some nations have better education, better environments, or better pay due to given circumstances. With globalisation, the talents and elites of nations which fall behind on such civil fronts often lose their skilled workforce as they immigrate to another country seeking personal benefits. Our school is a prime example where foreign parents come to China for lower costs of living or employment while rich Chinese students plan to go abroad for a better education. As labour moves from one nation to another, they also bring their money, causing their home nation to lose not only a worker but also their possessions. There are also tax and regulatory reasons why many companies choose to create shell companies in tax havens such as Angola or the UAE (Used by Apple, Google, etc).

# Changes due to trade

## Before trade

Goods and services are at equilibrium at default levels

## Exports after trade

Occurs when domestic prices are lower than world price

- Causes a contraction of domestic demand
- Expansion of total supply
    - Domestic supply drops

## Imports after trade

Occurs when domestic prices are higher than world price

- Causes an expansion in demand
- Contraction in supply
- Might require protectionism

## Notes:

- World supply is equal to world price
    - Each nation lacks the power to significantly affect the global market
- …
