# Marshall Lerner Condition and J-Curve

Imports > Exports

- The logic is that imports will become more expensive and exports will become cheaper due to depreciation
- Marshall Lerner condition is used to examine the effectiveness of this policy

# The conditions

- If the sum of the `PED` for imports and exports is greater than $PEDm+PEDx>1$, depreciation will improve the trade balance (smaller trade deficit)
- `> 1` → Smaller deficit
- `< 1` → Larger deficit
- `= 1` → No change
- Overall, you will find the greater the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, the greater the scope for improvements in trade balance

# Consequences

- Lower domestic consumption
- Insufficient domestic investment
- Appreciation of the domestic currency
- Inflation
- Employment
- Reduced export competitiveness
- Possibility of retaliation through trade barriers
