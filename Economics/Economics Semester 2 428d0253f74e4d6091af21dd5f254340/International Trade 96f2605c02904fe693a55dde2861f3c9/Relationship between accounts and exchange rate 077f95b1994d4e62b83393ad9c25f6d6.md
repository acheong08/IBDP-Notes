# Relationship between accounts and exchange rate

# Current Account

# Floating

Under floating exchange rates, when there is a deficit in the current account, market forces create a downward pressure on the currency exchange rate. When there is a surplus in the current account, market forces create an upward pressure on the currency exchange rate. As a result, exchange rate changes automatically eliminates current account deficit and surpluses and creates a balance in the balance of payments

# Managed

- Central bank uses reserve assets
- Deficit → Sell reserve currencies → Create credit item
- ‘Avoid depreciation and maintain exchange rate

# Fixed

In a fixed exchange rate system, the balance of payments are made by policies that change currency demand or supply in order to keep the exchange rate fixed.
