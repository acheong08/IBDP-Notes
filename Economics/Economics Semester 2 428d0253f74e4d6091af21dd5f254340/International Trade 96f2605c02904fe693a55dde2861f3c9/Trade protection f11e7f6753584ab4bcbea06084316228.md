# Tariffs

“Custom duties”

Taxes on import goods

## Protective tariff

Protects a domestic industry from foreign competition

## Revenue tariffs

Raises revenue for the government

## Effects of Tariffs

### Economy

- Increase in quantity supplied
    - $Q_2$
- Decrease in quantity demanded
    - $Q_3$
- Decrease in imports
    - $Q_3-Q_2$

### Domestic consumers suffer

- Higher price: $Pw+t$
- Consumers can only buy a smaller quantity: $Q_3$

### Domestic producers benefit

- They receive a higher price: $Pw+t$
- Higher quantity: $Q_2$

### Domestic employment increases

- Domestic producers require more employees due to higher quantities

### The government gains tariff revenue

- $t×(Q_3-Q_2)$

### Domestic income distribution worsens

- Regressive tax
- Equal absolute impact on all income ranges
- Lower incomes have higher relative impact

### Increased inefficiency in production

- $Pd>Pw$, indicates inefficiency
- Results in the waste of scarce resources

### Foreign producers suffer

- Exporting countries lose export
- Revenues fall due to lower quantity

### Inefficient global allocation of resources

- Shifts production away from more efficient foreign producers

# Quota

An import quota is a legal limit to the quantity of a good that can be imported over a particular time period, typically a year.

## How it works

The government will issue a limited number of quota licences determining the legal limit on the quantity of imports

The licence holders gain quota revenues (quota rents), as they can buy the good at a cheaper world price but sell at the higher domestic price

- The government could sell these licences to domestic importers
- The government could distribute quota licences to domestic importers for free
- *Most common*: The government gives the licences to the governments of exporting countries which then distributes them to their own exporters
    
    **The quota revenue goes to the party first holding the licences for free**

## Effects

### Domestic consumers are worse off

- They have to buy at $P_q$

### Domestic producers are better off

- They can sell at $P_q$

### Domestic employment increases

- Increased domestic production

### The government

- If they sell licences
    - No gain or loss
- Loses
    - In most cases

### Domestic income distribution

- Regressive cost

### Exporting countries

- Worse off when loss of `export revenue $>$ quota revenue`
- Better off when the opposite

### Global inefficient allocation of resources

- Decreased domestic consumption
- Inefficient domestic production

# Subsidy

# Administrative barriers

If it becomes too difficult to trade with a country, exporters will not trade with them

## Standards

Imposed requirements that imported goods must fulfil. Technical standards, health, safety, environmental, etc.

## Regulations

Customs procedures, inspections, valuation, etc.
