- Domestic supply curve shift to the right
- The good continues to sell at the world price
- Helps firms better compete with imports

# Effects of government subsidies

- Increased in quantity supplied, decrease in imports
    
    ## Research
    
    Quantity of imports: $Q_3-Q_2$
    
    Quantity of domestic supply: $Q_2$
    
    ### Why?
    
    - The cost of production has lowered for domestic production and thus they are given incentive to produce more.
    - Due to the increased supply from domestic firms, less imports are needed to make up the domestic shortage
    
    ### Effects
    
    - By allowing domestic firms to produce higher quantities, they naturally profit & benefit
    - To produce the higher quantity, more workers will need to be hired
- Consumption of goods are not affected
    - Consumers still pay the world price
    - Domestic firms take away market share from importers
    - Consumption of goods is not effected
- Domestic producers are better off
    - Increased quantity they can sell at
    - The price they sell at goes up
    - Increases revenue
    - $Q_1×P_w → Q_2×P_s$
- Negative effect on government budget
    - Cost: $(P_s-P_w)×Q_2$
- Taxpayers are worse off
    - Opportunity cost
    - Could have been spent on welfare
    - Source of subsidy funds comes from taxpayers
- Domestic employment increases
    - Domestic output increases from $Q_1 → Q_2$
    - Production increases through higher labour
- Increased inefficiency in production
    - Markets fail to allocate resources to the more efficient producer
    - Firms gets incentives for producing more than demanded
    - Production costs
    - They sell at higher price
- The exporting nations suffer
    - Due to the decrease in import market share
    - Loses: $(Q_3-Q_1)-(Q_3-Q_2)$
- A global inefficient allocation of resources
    - Same as increased inefficiency…
    - Inefficient domestic producers
    - Higher production cost than $P_w$
